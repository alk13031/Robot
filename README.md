Project to create a semi autonomous robot


The goal of this project is to create a robot capable of certain semiautonomous tasks such as line following and path planning given a goal destination. The robot will look and move similarly to a car: rear wheel drive with front wheel steering. The goal is to create this out of basic components and not a kit. 3D Printing will be used when necassary.

Below are the list of components used:
8 300mm 2020 Aluminum Extrudes (90 degree, straight brackets, hinges included)
4 SupeDroid Wheel and shafts
2 1/2 Bearings
2 5/8 Bearings
2 8mm shafts and flanges
4 8mm Pillow Bearings
2 Pololu 25D motors
2 MG995 Servo motors
1 4S4P battery pack wih BMS
1 12V output Buck Boost Voltage Convertor (120W)

Future:
1 Jetson Nano
1 Oak-D Lite Depth Camera
1 IMU
1 GPS
