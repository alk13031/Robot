The goal of this project is to create a robot capable of certain semiautonomous tasks such as line following and path planning given a goal destination. The robot will look and move similarly to a car: rear wheel drive with front wheel steering. The goal is to create this out of basic components and not a kit. 3D Printing used when necassary.

Below are the list of components used:  
8 300mm 2020 Aluminum Extrudes (90 degree, straight brackets, hinges included)  
4 SupeDroid Wheel and shafts  
2 1/2 Bearings  
2 5/8 Bearings  
2 8mm shafts and flanges  
4 8mm Pillow Bearings  
2 Pololu 25D motor  
2 MG995 Servo motor  
1 4S4P battery pack wih BMS  
1 12V output Buck Boost Voltage Convertor (120W)  

Future:  
1 Jetson Nano  
1 Oak-D Lite Depth Camera  
1 IMU  
1 GPS
