The goal of this project is to create a robot capable of certain semiautonomous tasks such as line following and path planning given a goal destination. The robot will look and move similarly to a car: rear wheel drive with front wheel steering. The goal is to create this out of basic components and not a kit. 3D Printing used when necassary.

Designed in Onshape, picture of top level assembly below:
